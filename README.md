#### This is a personal academic homepage

One wants to deploy the academic homepage as simple as possible.

I am trying to copy some templates of page layouts in certain blog deploying service. The source code reference includes

1. [Sample Resume Template | A Free HTML Resume Template by thingsthatarebrown.com](https://sampleresumetemplate.net/)
2. <i class="fa fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i>[GitHub Project](https://sampleresumetemplate.net/)
